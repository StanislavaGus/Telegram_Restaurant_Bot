   - The method is responsible for processing documents, but so far its implementation is empty (only receiving a message is logged).

 **`consumePhotoMessageUpdates(Update update)`**
- Annotation '@RabbitListener (queues = PHOTO_MESSAGE_UPDATE)` allows you to subscribe to the description of `PHOTO_MESSAGE_UPDATE'.
   - The method processes photo messages, logging their receipt (the implementation is being deleted for now).

#### The main task:
The 'ConsumeServiceImpl` class is responsible for consuming messages from RabbitMQ essays and processing them depending on the type (text, document, photo). For text messages, the user's response is sent via the 'produserAnswer` method.

---

### `ProducerServiceImpl.java`

This class implements the 'ProducerService` interface and is responsible for sending messages to the RabbitMQ essay.

- **Annotation `@Service`:** The class is located by the Spring component and is managed by the Spring container.
- **Annotation `@Log4j2`:** Adds support for logging using Log4j2.

#### Fields:
- **`RabbitTemplate RabbitTemplate`:** Used to send messages to RabbitMQ. The field is passed through the constructor using the `@Autowired` annotation.

#### Method:

**`produserAnswer(SendMessage sendMessage)`**
- This method sends a response message to the `ANSWER_MESSAGE` queue using the `RabbitTemplate`.
   - **`rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend (ANSWER_MESSAGE, sendMessage)`:** Sends the `SendMessage` object to the specified characteristic.

#### The main task:
`ProducerServiceImpl` implements sending messages to the RabbitMQ essay. This class is used to send reply messages to users after processing their incoming messages.

---

### Interaction:
- **'ConsumeServiceImpl`** is responsible for receiving messages from various essays and processing them. For example, when receiving a text message from the `TEXT_MESSAGE_UPDATE` queue, it uses the `ProducerService` to send a reply message.
- **`ProducerServiceImpl`** sends response messages to the `ANSWER_MESSAGE` description so that other system components can receive and process them.

Thus, both classes work together to provide asynchronous communication through RabbitMQ.

## Node/service

These classes manage logic related to users, preferences, allergies, sessions, and interactions with external APIs such as Foursquare.

---

###  `AllergyLoaderService.java`

**Task:** Loads allergies from a file and initializes the 'acceptable_allergies` table in the database.

- **The `init()`** method is called when the component is initialized. Recreates the table and loads data from the file `allergies.txt `.
- **The `recreateTable()` method** — recreates the 'acceptable_allergies` table.
- **The `loadAllergiesFromFile()' method** — reads data from a file and stores it in a database.

---

###  `FoursquareService.java`

**Task:** Interact with the Foursquare API to search for restaurants and get information about them.

- **The `searchRestaurants()` method** — generates a query to the Foursquare API to search for restaurants according to the specified parameters (location, keywords, sorting, price, etc.).
- **The `searchRandomRestaurant()` method** — executes a query to search for a random restaurant.
- **The `getRestaurantLink()` method** — gets a link to a restaurant by its 'fsqId` via the Foursquare API.

---

###  `PreferencesLoaderService.java`

**Task:** Loads preferences from a file and initializes the `available_preferences` table in the database.

- **The 'init()` method** — is called during component initialization, recreates the table and loads data from the file `preferences.txt `.
- **The `recreateTable()` method** — recreates the `available_preferences` table.
- **The `loadPreferencesFromFile()' method** — reads data from a file and stores it in a database.

---

###  `SessionService.java`

**Task:** Manages user sessions.

- **The `isUserLoggedIn()` method** — checks whether the user is logged in based on the `chatId'.
- **The `LoginUser()` method** — registers the user as authorized.
- **The `logOutUser()` method** — removes the user from the list of authorized users.
- **The `getUserId()` method** — returns the user ID by `chatId`.

---

### `UserService.java`

**Task:** Manages user data, preferences, allergies, and restaurant visits. Interacts with repositories and services to process requests.

- **Methods for working with users:**
  - **`addUser()`** — adds a new user, checking the uniqueness of the email and username.
  - **`authenticate()`** — verifies user authentication by username and password.
  - **`getUserIdByUsername()`** — returns the user ID by name.
  - **`getAllUsers()`** — returns a list of all users.

- **Methods for working with preferences:**
- **`addUserPreference()`** — adds the user's preference, checking if it has already been added.
  - **`getUserPreferences()`** — returns all user preferences.
  - **`deleteUserPreference()`** — deletes the user's preference.

- **Methods for dealing with allergies:**
- **`addUserAllergy()`** — adds an allergy to the user, checking if it has already been added.
  - **`getUserAllergies()`** — returns all the user's allergies.
  - **`deleteUserAllergy()`** — removes the user's allergy.
  - **`isAcceptableAllergy()`** — checks whether the allergy is acceptable (whether it is present in the `acceptable_allergies` table).

- **Methods for working with visits:**
- **`addVisit()`** — adds a restaurant visit for the user.
  - **`getVisitList()`** — returns the list of user visits.
  - **`markVisited()`** — marks the restaurant as visited.
  - **`removeVisit()`** — deletes the record of the restaurant visit.

- **Methods for working with restaurants via the Foursquare API:**
- **`findRestaurant()`** — searches for restaurants.
  - **`requestRandomRestaurant()`** — searches for a random restaurant.

---

### The main task:
Classes provide various services for working with users, preferences, allergies, restaurant visits, as well as interacting with external APIs.

## Node/NodeApplication.java

The 'NodeApplication` class is the entry point for launching a Spring application that uses several configuration classes to configure various components such as RabbitMQ, Tomcat, and a database. This class manually initializes the Spring context using the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext'.

### Basic elements:

 **`AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`**:
- This class is used to create a Spring context based on Java configurations.
   - Configuration classes are passed to the constructor arguments, which will be used to configure the application components.

**Configuration classes:**
- **`RabbitMQConfigg`** — configuration for RabbitMQ.
   - **`RabbitConfigurationn`** — additional configuration for RabbitMQ.
   - **`TomcatConfigg`** — configuration for the embedded Tomcat server.
   - **`DatabaseConfig`** — configuration for connecting to a database using JDBC.
   - **`ReactiveDatabaseConfig`** — a reactive configuration for connecting to a database using R2DBC.

 **Starting Tomcat**:
- After initializing the context, the `TomcatConfigg` bin is extracted to make sure that the Tomcat server is properly configured and running.

### Tasks:

**Initializing the Spring context**:
- The application uses several configuration classes to configure databases, RabbitMQ and the embedded Tomcat server.
   - `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` initializes all these classes and components in the Spring context.

 **Launching Tomcat**:
   - In the last line, the `TomcatConfigg` bean is extracted, which indicates that the application runs the embedded Tomcat server if it has been configured correctly.

### The main task:
The 'NodeApplication` class launches the application by creating a Spring context and configuring key components such as RabbitMQ, database, and Tomcat server using Java configurations.
